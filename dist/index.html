                paragraph1: "I am a native of Kawel, Mushere by tribe, in Bokkos Local Government Area of Plateau State, Nigeria. Growing up, I discovered I had a natural strength in Mathematics, which later influenced my decision to study Computer Science. Although I had interest in the subject during secondary school, I didn't feel confident enough to pursue it at the time. It took a few years after finishing school for me to finally take that bold step.",
                paragraph2: "Aside from academics, I've always loved music. I sang in the choir and played the keyboard for my church band from my teenage years into my late twenties. These experiences helped me build discipline, focus, and creativity—qualities that have helped me in my tech journey. In 2020, I got married on the 15th of February, and I am grateful to be a father to a wonderful son.",
                paragraph3: "Choosing to study Computer Science was one of the most important decisions I made. It gave me the chance to explore programming, which I discovered I was quite good at. That discovery marked the beginning of my journey into the world of technology."

            {
                title: "Journey in Tech",
                paragraph1: "After graduation, I got my first job and was assigned to a unit responsible for developing web applications. I was new to web technologies at the time, but I took the challenge seriously. I started learning HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL on my own, determined to grow and contribute to my team.",
                paragraph2: "During my time there, I worked on a few exciting projects. I designed the frontend of the organization's official website and later worked on the frontend of a payment gateway application. Although backend development was still a struggle for me, I kept learning and practicing in my free time, eager to improve.",
                paragraph3: "Later, I moved to another organization where I had the opportunity to develop about two full applications—this time handling both frontend and backend. These experiences boosted my confidence and sharpened my skills, but I still felt there was more to learn. I wanted deeper knowledge and better understanding of modern development practices."
            },
            {
                title: "Current Journey in Tech at Blockfuse Labs",
                paragraph1: "In January 2025, I joined Blockfuse Labs—a program focused on modern Web 2.0 fullstack development. Since the 6th or 7th of that month, I've been learning and building in a more structured and intensive way than ever before. It's been almost four months of solid growth and hands-on experience.",
                paragraph2: "The program has helped me improve in both frontend and backend development. I've learned new tools, frameworks, and best practices for building world-class applications. It has been both challenging and exciting, and I now feel more confident in my abilities as a fullstack developer.",
                paragraph3: "In less than two months, I will complete the program. I'm looking forward to this achievement and the opportunities it will bring. Blockfuse Labs also prepares developers for Web 3.0 and blockchain development. I hope and pray that I qualify for this next phase. Becoming a Blockchain Engineer would be a dream come true and the biggest milestone in my tech journey so far."
